HTML Basics README
Welcome to the HTML Basics README! This guide will provide you with essential information on creating well-structured HTML pages, utilizing semantic tags, understanding when to use div vs. span, and integrating various media and external content into your webpages. Let's dive in!

Creating the Skeleton of an HTML5 Page
To create the skeleton of an HTML5 page, follow this basic structure:

html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

Using Semantic HTML Tags
Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the content they surround. Here are some common semantic tags and their purposes:

<header>: Represents introductory content at the beginning of a section or webpage.
<main>: Contains the central content of the document.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a section or webpage.
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
<nav>: Represents a section of navigation links.
<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
<aside>: Represents content tangentially related to the content around it.
Choosing Between div and span
Use <div> when you need to group elements for styling or scripting purposes and <span> when you need to apply styles or scripting to a small piece of text within a line.

Importance of Headings
Headings (<h1> to <h6>) provide structure and hierarchy to your content. Follow the hierarchical order (h1 to h6) to maintain accessibility and SEO best practices.

Making Lists in HTML
Use <ul> for unordered lists, <ol> for ordered lists, and <li> for list items. Example:

html
```
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

Understanding Different Media Types
SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics, ideal for graphics and icons that need to scale without losing quality.
GIF: Graphics Interchange Format, suitable for animations with limited colors.
PNG: Portable Network Graphics, great for images with transparency and detailed graphics.
JPG: Joint Photographic Experts Group, suitable for high-quality photographic images.
Structuring Data in a Table
Use the <table>, <tr>, <td>, and <th> tags to create tables in HTML. <th> is for table headers, and <td> is for table data.

Integrating Video and Audio
To integrate video, use the <video> tag and specify the video file(s) in different formats for cross-browser compatibility. For audio, use the <audio> tag similarly.

Embedding External Content
Use <iframe> to embed external content such as maps, videos, or other webpages into your HTML document.

Correctly Structuring an HTML Page
Ensure your HTML page follows a logical structure, with proper use of semantic tags, headings, lists, and media elements to enhance accessibility and SEO.

That's it! You're now equipped with the fundamentals of HTML to create well-structured web pages. Happy coding! ðŸš€
